* What is http://kickhub.com?

http://kickhub.com aims at making it easier for free software users to
donate to developers, and for free software developers to make it
easier to reach the right potential donators.  It handle both direct
and unconditional donations, and delayed/conditional donations, so
this can be used as a crowdfunding system -- except that you pick the
payment system you usually use.
