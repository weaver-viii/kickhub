* About

KickHub is about boosting donations to free softwares.

It helps *users* discover existing or future free softwares they want
to donate to, and it helps *developers* find their donators.

Each project is listed on a public page, where everyone can see the
amount of donations received by the contributors.

"Projects" are of two kinds:

- /existing projects/, for which users can donate immediately ;
- /future projects/, for which users can either donate immediately or
  later.

Each time a user commit to donate to a project, the user and the
developer receive an email notification.  When the transaction is
done, the developer confirms it.
