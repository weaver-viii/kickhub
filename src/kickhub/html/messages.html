<div id="about">
  <p>
    KickHub is about boosting donations to free softwares.
  </p>

  <p>
    It helps <b>users</b> discover existing or future free softwares they want
    to donate to, and it helps <b>developers</b> find their donators.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each project is listed on a public page, where everyone can see the
    amount of donations received by the contributors.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Projects" are of two kinds:
  </p>

  <ul class="org-ul">
    <li><i>existing projects</i>, for which users can donate immediately ;
    </li>
    <li><i>future projects</i>, for which users can either donate immediately or
      later.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each time a user commit to donate to a project, the user and the
    developer receive an email notification.  When the transaction is
    done, the developer confirms it.
